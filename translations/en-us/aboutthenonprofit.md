About the Nonprofit
==================


# Our Core Operating Policy:
* All of the organization's operational policies and procedures shall conform to the decision-making process which is optimal for the well-being of human animals, formally known as G2, except in cases where legal jurisdictions require us to do otherwise. 
* In such cases, the affected policies and procedures shall be clearly marked as coerced policy deviations, and clear references to the offending laws shall be provided.
* The status of all coerced policy deviations will be reviewed in board meetings to see if they are still legally required. If the board determines that a coerced policy deviation is no longer required, affected policies and procedures shall be brought back into G2 compliance within three months of this determination.
* The organization's finances shall be fully public, in conformance with G2 practice.
* To ensure that our business practices remain focused on care for human animals, we will not generate revenue through any means other than donation.

# Core goals of the non-profit organization:
* Making the theory and practice of perfect love available to everyone.
* Completing any remaining gaps in the theory and collecting culture-specific extensions.
* Researching and creating an electronic social communication network optimized for small-scale to global-scale human connection and G2 decision-making, in addition to being optimized for the two goals above.

# Our short-term goals:
* Bring the organization into legal existence.
* Document the organization for publication on the website.
* Setup the organization to accept the donations it will depend on.
* Create a minimal starting web site:
    * The web site tech will be chosen carefully as a base for our long term goals, which will approach very quickly. Our tech base needs to be rock-solid and to have future-proofing boundaries and criteria for where and how to insert better tech as it becomes available. 
    * The site will offer this content, added in priority order:
    1. A minimal and complete objective explanation of G2. This will be the most efficient delivery for technical-centric listeners.
    2. At least one explanation that focuses on subjective descriptions of G2. This will appeal to more heart-centric listeners.
    3. The site will organize its G2 educational content so that it helps people structure their learning. Collaboration with others in that process will be added as soon as possible.
    4. The site will expose the internal finances and decisions of the non-profit.
* Attract contributors to the human connection software projects.

# Our immediate needs:
* At least three board members for Hawaii incorporation.
* Advisors for the non-profit organization.
* Policies, procedures, and other required documents for Hawaii incorporation.
* A modest income stream to pay for server hosting.

# Current personnel:
* Roy Sprowl, G2 author. Retired control systems engineer and software developer. Doing all the work at this point.
