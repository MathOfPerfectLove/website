Explaining the G2 Math of Perfect Love

# G0, G1, G2: Three Different Kinds of Optimal Decision-Making
The math of G2 recognizes three broad categories of animal decision-making, each optimized for a different strategic environment.
## G0: Optimized for reproductive success

## G1: Optimized for "reproductive success" within an evolved human culture

## G2: Optimized for the well-being of the host animal

# What  "love" means in G2
Within G2, the verb "love" is captured by this statement:
> **To love someone is to give them what they need in a way that is resilient to the passage of time and changes in circumstances.**

Subjectively, this simple statement captures the archetypical love that flows from a well-supported and emotionally healthy mother to her newborn, which contains multiple distinct subjective viewpoints and a rich, but finite and knowable set of emotional meanings and experiences within those viewpoints.

## There are many valid subjective viewpoints and experiences
Within G2, the word "subjective" has two dimensions.
1. The first dimension is "viewpoint", and it refers to the identity and worldview of the person having the experience, plus 

## There is a single valid objective description
an objective description of G2 love 
Objectively, this capture of the G2 meaning of love then points directly at two extremely well-studied systems-engineering concepts. The first concept is *distributed systems*, which is invoked because the mother and the child exist in two different physical locations. The second concept is *adaptive feedback loop*, which exactly overlaps the meaning of "To love someone is to give them what they need in a way that is resilient to the passage of time and changes in circumstances.". 

And as unlikely as it may seem, the well-understood optimal behavior of an adaptive feedback loop within a distributed system directly yeilds a simple and fully prescriptive recipe for the optimal way for one human being to love another.

## The G2 relationship between the subjective and objective meanings
Because G2 is an complete mathematical model of human decision-making, it becomes possible to infer all of the subjective viewpoints and the full range of feelings those viewpoints may experience. This means that a full understanding of love requires both a full objective understanding of the math of G2, plus a full experiental understanding of what it is like to be in all the relevant emotional states of each of the contained viewpoints.


Because G2 is an objectively accurate mathematical model of human decision-making, 

There are two equally valid ways to explain the math of perfect love: 
* The primarily objecive, where G2 is explained in terms of observable physical processes. 
* The primarily subjective, where G2 is explained in terms of emotional experience, human interaction, and personal relationship.



    1. A minimal and complete objective explanation of G2. This will be the most efficient delivery for technical-centric listeners.
    2. At least one explanation that focuses on subjective descriptions of G2. This will appeal to more heart-centric listeners.
