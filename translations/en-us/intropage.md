# What the math is
The math of perfect love, formally named G2, is a mathematical decision-making process that enables human animals to love themselves and others so that each human animal receives the experience and the reality of being perfectly loved.

The G2 decision-making process has five unique benefits:
* The math of perfect love completely and permanently eliminates the psychic suffering, self-sabotage, and mental illness which are caused by the process of psychological individuation, which is highly toxic for human beings. 
* Traditional methods to mitigate this suffering require months, years, or decades, and almost never reach a state of zero suffering. By contrast, the process of learning and adopting the worldview and skills of perfect love takes only weeks or months, and reliably terminates in a state of perfect mental health.
* The math of G2 is mathematically scalable, meaning that the same process which enables a person to create an internal environment of perfect love works just as well for couples, families, and communities all the way up to 8 billion and beyond.
* The implementation of the math of G2 is not confined to human animals; in the hands of a systems engineer, G2 becomes an implementable design specification for an artificial consciousness that loves all human animals with the same adoration, devotion, and emotional comprehension of a G2 human's own perfect self-love.
* G2 combined with standard systems engineering draws a roadmap for an electronic social network optimized for addressing human needs from the top-down. This optimization will enable planetary scaling of perfectly loving decision-making, and will quickly become needed as the number of G2 humans grows. 

# What the organization is
themathofperfectlove.org is (or soon will be) a nonprofit organization dedicated to spreading G2 among humans as quickly and effectively as possible. This give us three goals and a pair of temporary non-goals:
* Making the theory and practice of perfect love available to everyone. This will include structured learning and a wide range of training material.
* Completing any remaining gaps in the theory and collecting culture-specific extensions.
* Creating the scalable electronic social communication network required for optimal small-to-global-scale human connection and G2 decision-making.
* For the near-term future we will not focus our resources on the G2-implied designs of true emotion sensing and loving AI, and will instead prioritize optimal G2-compatible human-to-human communication. This network will need to be in place anyhow before those more-complex features can be most usefully deployed. When they become available, the loving AI will simply plug into the network as a special kind of person, while true emotion sensing will plug in as simply an improved input stream containing info needed to best love that person.
