## Overview
### What is the math of perfect love?
The *math of perfect love* is a mathematical recipe for a human-based decision-making process which is optimized *for the benefit of the human animal who is making the decisions*. This mathematical recipe is formally named *G2*. 

### What about other human beings besides the G2 decision-maker?
Objectively, the G2 mathematical model recognizes that the optimal environment for human animals is to be integrated into a web of connection with other humans who use the G2 decision-making process.

Subjectively, this is simply saying that the safest and most fulfilling environment for a human being is within a "chosen family" of people who love each other unconditionally.

This recognition leads immediately to the implication that decision-making which is optimal for the host animal must also optimize
